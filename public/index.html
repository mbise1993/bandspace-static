        <h2>Everything for your band. Together.</h2>
        <p>
          Bandspace is an app built for musicians, by musicians. It aims to be the hub for
          everything that keeps your band running smoothly - from messaging to scheduling to file
          storage and everything in between.

            <h4>Messaging</h4>
            <p>
              The only messaging app your band needs. Use channels to organize your discussions so
              that important announcements don't get lost amongst the memes.

            <h4>Files and Storage</h4>
            <p>
              Tired of using various cloud storage providers to keep up with your demos, mix
              revisions, promo pics, designs, etc.? We are too. That's why Bandspace comes with a
              built-in file manager to keep track of all your band's things.

              Bandspace gives you a shared calendar so that everyone stays on the same page. No more
              asking "When are we practicing again?" or "What day is the next show?".

              fans, Bandspace has you covered. Link all your band's social media accounts to
